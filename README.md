# Turbomachinery-Project
Simple script to get a 3D STL model of an axial compressor rotor stage.

The following script is conceived to use a CSV file extracted from an Excel Spreadsheet, the results 
from several calculations for the design of an axial compressor stage are exported and then used in this 
script to generate 4 specific files:

- Rotor
- Fairing
- Complete Stage
- Blade
